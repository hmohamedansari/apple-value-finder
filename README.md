# Apple Value Finder

## Description

Apple Value Finder is a web application designed to help users find the best value Apple products (MacBooks, iPhones, iMacs, etc.) within a specified budget in Indian Rupees (INR). The application scrapes product data from the official Apple India website, processes this data, and presents users with product recommendations based on their budget and a value scoring system.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Web Scraping:** Python (using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`)
*   **Data Format:** JSON

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
*   Python 3.7+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hmohamedansari/apple-value-finder
    cd apple-value-finder
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    *   **For macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **For Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses several Python libraries. You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file if you haven't already.
    *   **If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one by running:**
        ```bash
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        ```
        (Make sure to run this *after* installing all necessary packages like Flask, requests, BeautifulSoup4 in your virtual environment).
    *   **Once you have the `requirements.txt` file in the repository, install the dependencies:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    Common dependencies will likely include:
    *   `Flask`
    *   `requests`
    *   `beautifulsoup4`
    *   `lxml` (often used with BeautifulSoup for parsing)

4.  **Run the Web Scraper:**
    The scraper (`scraper.py`) fetches product data from the Apple India website and saves it to `apple_products.json`.
    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    ```
    This will generate/update the `apple_products.json` file in the root directory.

5.  **Run the Flask Application:**
    The main application logic is in `app.py`.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    By default, the application should run on `http://127.0.0.1:10001/` (as per our previous discussions, ensure the port is correctly set in `app.py`). Open this URL in your web browser to use the application.
